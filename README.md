# Cat Files Mockup

This repository contains a ZIP archive () of sample files demonstrating a messy folder structure and file naming conventions. Use these mockups for hands-on exercises in organizing data with clear naming conventions and logical folder hierarchies. The purpose of this exercise is to make a folder structure and rename files so they follow a logical set of rules. The information about the files is limited so the person (group) doing the exercise can decide what the files are.

This repository includes a ZIP archive (```catfiles.zip```) containing sample files that illustrate a messy and inconsistent folder structure with poor naming conventions.

Use this dataset for hands-on practice in:
- Designing clear, logical folder hierarchies
- Renaming files to follow consistent, meaningful conventions
- Applying organizational strategies based on inferred file content

🔍 **Note:** The files contain a minimal description, encouraging participants (individuals or groups) to make decisions about file categorization and naming based on context and reasoning.
This exercise is ideal for workshops, teaching clean data practices, or testing organizational strategies.

## Contents of the ZIP

The ```catfiles.zip``` archive includes the following files:

```finalfinal_list_of_cats.txt```
A simple text file listing cat names with placeholder entries.

```febhealth.docx``` 
A short Word document with February health check notes for cats.

```meowdata2_final.xlsx``` and ```spreadsheetcopy5.xlsx```
Spreadsheets containing sample cat data.

```notes_about_new_cats_v3_FINAL.docx```
Unstructured staff notes about new cat arrivals.

```IMG001.png```
Photo of all the cats currently in the shelter

```photos.zip```
Contains individual photos of cats

## Exercise Instructions

1) Download and unzip ```catfiles.zip``` into your working directory. OR Access [🔗 Open the Cat Files Sandbox](https://p3d2.github.io/catFiles/)

2) Review the existing folder (if included) and files to identify inconsistencies.

3) Redesign the folder structure and rename files using best practices:

4) Use descriptive, concise filenames (e.g., YYYYMMDD_description.ext).

5) Organize files into logical folders (e.g., data/raw, docs, photos).

6) Document your conventions:
  - Create a README.md (or update this one) with your naming and folder rules.
  - Optionally, prepare a slide or report showcasing your improvements.
