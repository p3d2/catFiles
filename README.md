# Cat Files Mockup

This repository contains a ZIP archive (```catfiles.zip```) of sample files demonstrating a messy folder structure and file naming conventions. Use these mockups for hands-on exercises in organizing data with clear naming conventions and logical folder hierarchies.

## Contents of the ZIP

The ```catfiles.zip``` archive includes the following files:

```finalfinal_list_of_cats.txt```
A simple text file listing cat names with placeholder entries.

```febhealth.docx``` 
A short Word document with February health check notes for cats.

```meowdata2_final.xlsx``` and ```spreadsheetcopy5.xlsx```
Spreadsheets containing sample cat data.

```notes_about_new_cats_v3_FINAL.docx```
Unstructured staff notes about new cat arrivals.

```IMG001.png```
Photo of all the cats currently in the shelter

```photos.zip```
Contains individual photos of cats

## Exercise Instructions

1) Download and unzip ```catfiles.zip``` into your working directory. OR Access [ðŸ”— Open the Cat Files Sandbox](https://p3d2.github.io/catFiles/)

2) Review the existing folder (if included) and files to identify inconsistencies.

3) Redesign the folder structure and rename files using best practices:

4) Use descriptive, concise filenames (e.g., YYYYMMDD_description.ext).

5) Organize files into logical folders (e.g., data/raw, docs, photos).

6) Document your conventions:
  - Create a README.md (or update this one) with your naming and folder rules.
  - Optionally, prepare a slide or report showcasing your improvements.
