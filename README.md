# Cat Files Mockup

This repository contains a ZIP archive (```catfiles.zip```) of sample files demonstrating a messy folder structure and file naming conventions. Use these mockups for hands-on exercises in organizing data with clear naming conventions and logical folder hierarchies.

## Contents of the ZIP

The ```catfiles.zip``` archive includes the following files:

Tree:

## Exercise Instructions

1) Download and unzip ```catfiles.zip``` into your working directory.

2) Review the existing folder (if included) and files to identify inconsistencies.

3) Redesign the folder structure and rename files using best practices:

4) Use descriptive, concise filenames (e.g., YYYYMMDD_description.ext).

5) Organize files into logical folders (e.g., data/raw, docs, photos).

6) Document your conventions:
  - Create a README.md (or update this one) with your naming and folder rules.
  - Optionally, prepare a slide or report showcasing your improvements.
