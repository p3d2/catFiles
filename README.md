# Cat Files Mockup

This repository contains a ZIP archive (```catfiles.zip```) of sample files demonstrating a messy folder structure and file naming conventions. Use these mockups for hands-on exercises in organizing data with clear naming conventions and logical folder hierarchies.

## Contents of the ZIP

The catfiles.zip archive includes the following files:

Tree:

## Exercise Instructions

1) Download and unzip catfiles.zip into your working directory.

2) Review the existing folder (if included) and files to identify inconsistencies.

3) Redesign the folder structure and rename files using best practices:

4) Use descriptive, concise filenames (e.g., YYYYMMDD_description.ext).

5) Organize files into logical folders (e.g., data/raw, docs, photos).

6) Document your conventions:
  - Create a README.md (or update this one) with your naming and folder rules.
  - Optionally, prepare a slide or report showcasing your improvements.
